# Inverse Computational Morphology of Debris and Alluvial Fans

The forward method, developed by [Chen and Capart (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105228), simulates alluvial fan topography using a fast algorithm based on the visibility polygon. This method requires initial terrain data, apex location, and the elevation-distance relationship (elevation profile) as inputs to create a detailed topographic model of the alluvial fan.

This project focuses on the inverse approach, which extracts the elevation-distance relationship from fan topography using the visibility polygon. This extracted profile can then be used as input for the forward method to accurately reconstruct the fan topography.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **MATLAB** (version R2021a or later recommended)
- **Required Toolbox**: Mapping Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox


## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Add the 'functions' folder to your MATLAB path.
2. Navigate to the main directory of the project.
3. Run the demo script by entering the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

    ```matlab
    run('demo_inverse_forward_methods.m')
    ```

The demo script includes:
- Loading example GeoTiff data files: `topo_post_event` (alluvial fan terrain), `shape_fan_boundary` (fan boundary polygon shapefile), and `topo_pre_event` (initial terrain).
- Clipping the alluvial fan topography using the boundary polygon.
- Mapping shortest path distances within and along the boundary.
- Applying median filtering and quadratic fitting to the elevation-distance relationship.
- Using the forward method to reconstruct the fan topography with the extracted profile.

**Median Filtering and Quadratic Fitting:**

```matlab
% With median filter applied
fitting_s_z_within_boundary = process_s_z_relationship(sMap, zMesh_post_crop, bin_size, ds, outlength, 1);

- **Outputs:**
  - `fitting_s_z_within_boundary` and `fitting_s_z_along_boundary`: Processed elevation-distance relationships fitted with a quadratic function.



**Reconstruct the Fan Using the Forward Method:**
